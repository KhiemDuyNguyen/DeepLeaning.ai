    "The identity block is the standard block used in ResNets, and corresponds to the case where the input activation (say $a^{[l]}$) has the same dimension as the output activation (say $a^{[l+2]}$). To flesh out the different steps of what happens in a ResNet's identity block, here is an alternative diagram showing the individual steps:\n",

    "You've implemented the ResNet identity block. Next, the ResNet \"convolutional block\" is the other type of block.

For example, to reduce the activation dimensions's height and width by a factor of 2, you can use a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2. The CONV2D layer on the shortcut path does not use any non-linear activation function. Its main role is to just apply a (learned) linear function that reduces the dimension of the input, so that the dimensions match up for the later addition step. \n",
