    "### 1.2 - Forward propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, there are built-in functions that carry out the convolution steps for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.nn.conv2d(X,W1, strides = [1,s,s,1], padding = 'SAME'):** given an input $X$ and a group of filters $W1$, this function convolves $W1$'s filters on X. The third input ([1,s,s,1]) represents the strides for each dimension of the input (m, n_H_prev, n_W_prev, n_C_prev). You can read the full documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.nn.max_pool(A, ksize = [1,f,f,1], strides = [1,s,s,1], padding = 'SAME'):** given an input A, this function uses a window of size (f, f) and strides of size (s, s) to carry out max pooling over each window. You can read the full documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/max_pool)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.nn.relu(Z1):** computes the elementwise ReLU of Z1 (which can be any shape). You can read the full documentation [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/relu)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.contrib.layers.flatten(P)**: given an input P, this function flattens each example into a 1D vector it while maintaining the batch-size. It returns a flattened tensor with shape [batch_size, k]. You can read the full documentation [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/flatten)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(F, num_outputs):** given a the flattened input F, it returns the output computed using a fully connected layer. You can read the full documentation [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/layers/fully_connected)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last function above (`tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected`), the fully connected layer automatically initializes weights in the graph and keeps on training them as you train the model. Hence, you did not need to initialize those weights when initializing the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `forward_propagation` function below to build the following model: `CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FULLYCONNECTED`. You should use the functions above. \n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, we will use the following parameters for all the steps:\n",
    "     - Conv2D: stride 1, padding is \"SAME\"\n",
    "     - ReLU\n",
    "     - Max pool: Use an 8 by 8 filter size and an 8 by 8 stride, padding is \"SAME\"\n",
    "     - Conv2D: stride 1, padding is \"SAME\"\n",
    "     - ReLU\n",
    "     - Max pool: Use a 4 by 4 filter size and a 4 by 4 stride, padding is \"SAME\"\n",
    "     - Flatten the previous output.\n",
    "     - FULLYCONNECTED (FC) layer: Apply a fully connected layer without an non-linear activation function. Do not call the softmax here. This will result in 6 neurons in the output layer, which then get passed later to a softmax. In TensorFlow, the softmax and cost function are lumped together into a single function, which you'll call in a different function when computing the cost. "
