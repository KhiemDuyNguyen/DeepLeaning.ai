    "### 2.2 - Filtering with a threshold on class scores\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to apply a first filter by thresholding. You would like to get rid of any box for which the class \"score\" is less than a chosen threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model gives you a total of 19x19x5x85 numbers, with each box described by 85 numbers. It'll be convenient to rearrange the (19,19,5,85) (or (19,19,425)) dimensional tensor into the following variables:  \n",
    "- `box_confidence`: tensor of shape $(19 \\times 19, 5, 1)$ containing $p_c$ (confidence probability that there's some object) for each of the 5 boxes predicted in each of the 19x19 cells.\n",
    "- `boxes`: tensor of shape $(19 \\times 19, 5, 4)$ containing $(b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$ for each of the 5 boxes per cell.\n",
    "- `box_class_probs`: tensor of shape $(19 \\times 19, 5, 80)$ containing the detection probabilities $(c_1, c_2, ... c_{80})$ for each of the 80 classes for each of the 5 boxes per cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Implement `yolo_filter_boxes()`.\n",
    "1. Compute box scores by doing the elementwise product as described in Figure 4. The following code may help you choose the right operator: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = np.random.randn(19*19, 5, 1)\n",
    "b = np.random.randn(19*19, 5, 80)\n",
    "c = a * b # shape of c will be (19*19, 5, 80)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. For each box, find:\n",
    "    - the index of the class with the maximum box score ([Hint](https://keras.io/backend/#argmax)) (Be careful with what axis you choose; consider using axis=-1)\n",
    "    - the corresponding box score ([Hint](https://keras.io/backend/#max)) (Be careful with what axis you choose; consider using axis=-1)\n",
    "3. Create a mask by using a threshold. As a reminder: `([0.9, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.1] < 0.4)` returns: `[False, True, False, False, True]`. The mask should be True for the boxes you want to keep. \n",
    "4. Use TensorFlow to apply the mask to box_class_scores, boxes and box_classes to filter out the boxes we don't want. You should be left with just the subset of boxes you want to keep. ([Hint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/boolean_mask))\n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder: to call a Keras function, you should use `K.function(...)`."
